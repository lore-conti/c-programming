# C Programming Notes, Tips & Tricks

20190826

This is a collection of notes, examples, tips & tricks on C programming language I put together some time ago just for my reference to remember the lesson learned. \
Some notes and examples are mine, some I found in books and web pages I read (see references at the end of the document, all rights reserved to the relevant owner). \
Something is obsolete, something still a good example. Take it as it is, if you want. \ 
I hold no responsibility for any damage or failure caused by using this document. It is very likely that the contents of the document might change from time to time and might even be mistaken at some places. \ 
Use this document as per your own discretion.
